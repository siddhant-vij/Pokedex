# Pokedex

A Pokedex is just a make-believe device that lets us look up information about any Pokemon - things like their name, type, and stats. A command-line REPL, using the Pok√©API to power all of the data that's needed.

## Goals

- Parse JSON in Go
- Making HTTP requests in Go
- A CLI tool interacting with a back-end API
- Local Go development and tooling
- Caching to improve performance
- Update the CLI to support the "up/down" arrow to cycle through previous commands

<br>

## Future Improvements
- Simulate battles between pokemon
- Add unit tests
- Refactor your code to organize it better and make it more testable
- Keep pokemon in a "party" and allow them to level up
- Allow for pokemon that are caught to evolve after a set amount of time
- Persist a user's Pokedex to disk so they can save progress between sessions
- Use the PokeAPI to make exploration more interesting. For example, rather than typing the names of areas, maybe you are given choices of areas and just type "left" or "right"
- Random encounters with wild pokemon
- Adding support for different types of balls (Pokeballs, Great Balls, Ultra Balls, etc), which have different chances of catching pokemon
